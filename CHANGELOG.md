# Changelog

See [the `r3` package's `CHANGELOG.md`](./src/r3/CHANGELOG.md).

---

R3 is distributed as a [monorepo][] (poorly) mimicing the style of [lerna][]. This was inspired by several other large open-source projects distributed this way, including [React][], [Gatsby][], etc.

This means that our `CHANGELOG.md` files are distributed alongside the package itself in the `src` directory.

For example, the package `r3_portkit` has a CHANGELOG.md in [`src/r3_portkit/CHANGELOG.md`](./src/r3_portkit/CHANGELOG.md). If you'd like to check out others, check out the [`src`](./src) directory in the root of the repo.
