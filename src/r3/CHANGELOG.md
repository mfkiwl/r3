This release only includes changes to the documentation.

## [0.1.2] - 2021-10-23

### Changed

- **Breaking (semver-exempt):** Change the target compiler version to `nightly-2021-10-18`
- Upgrade `tokenlock` to `0.3.4`
- Using the new version of `tokenlock`, some atomics-based hacks were removed. This might marginally improve the runtime performance as the compiler is given more leeway to optimize memory accesses.

### Fixed

- The debug printing of `Mutex` and `RecursiveMutex` in an invalid context now produces a message that makes sense.
